# Movie Rating and Data Tracker

## Elevator Pitch

Was the movie worth the budget? I want to track movie ratings and other pertinent information regarding the film for statistical analysis.

## Project Requirements

  * Simple feature set
  * CRUD application
  * Interesting and complex queries

## Feature List:

  * Enter in a movie along with a title, year, rating, length, budget, and genre.
  * Queries include:
    * Films by name, genre, year, and rating (averages, etc.)
    * Search for films with highest budget, best ratings
    * Which film rating requires the most budget? Is the longest?
  * Delete and update movies and their ratings

## Interesting Query

What films had the most critical acclaim for the budget? What years had the most well-received films?

## Data Source

Movie data is from IMDb, and movies can be added by the user.
